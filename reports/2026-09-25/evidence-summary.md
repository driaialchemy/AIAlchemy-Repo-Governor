# AIAlchemy Repo Governor — Weekly Evidence Report

**Report date:** 2026-09-25T00:54:10+00:00
**GitHub owner:** driaialchemy
**Run mode:** scan_only

## Executive Summary

Repo Governor discovered 13 repositories under driaialchemy. 13 were eligible for scanning. 13 were scanned successfully. 0 were skipped because they were archived, forks, excluded by configuration, or otherwise disabled.
2 passed agent-readiness checks and 11 still need governance work.

Repo Governor scanned 13 repositories under driaialchemy. 2 of 13 scanned repositories are agent-ready. 6 repositories are high-risk and should receive human review before any remediation agent is used. The most common issues are 6 repos with credential pattern indicators and 6 repos with high-risk repos needing controls. The safest next step is to add agent policy files on a medium-risk repo such as AgentAuditLogger using prompt_only mode.

The evidence report was emailed successfully.
